# Web Browser Data Structure in C++

## Overview
This project implements a web browser data structure in C++ to replicate the functionalities of a typical browser, including setting a homepage, visiting URLs, and navigating backward and forward in history.

## Problem Statement
The task was to create a data structure that mimics the functionalities of a web browser, supporting functions like setting a homepage, visiting URLs, moving backward and forward in history, all while handling edge cases efficiently.

## Implementation
The project is implemented in C++ and consists of two main classes:
- **Node**: Represents each webpage with pointers to the next and previous pages in history.
- **Browser**: Manages the browser's state and history seamlessly, utilizing nodes to implement functionalities.

## Features Implemented
1. **Set Homepage**: Users can set their desired homepage.
2. **Visit URL**: Visit any URL and clear forward history.
3. **Backward Navigation**: Move backward in history by a specified number of steps.
4. **Forward Navigation**: Move forward in history by a specified number of steps, handling edge cases gracefully.

## Sample Input/Output
[Include a concise example demonstrating the functionality of the browser]

## Challenges Faced
Handling edge cases efficiently, such as reaching the limit of backward or forward steps, was a notable challenge. However, through careful design and testing, I was able to address these issues effectively.

## Takeaways
This project has honed my skills in data structure design and problem-solving, providing valuable insights into managing complex systems efficiently.

## Future Steps
- Further optimize the code for better performance.
- Explore additional functionalities to enhance the browser experience.

I'm excited about the journey this project has taken me on and eager to hear your thoughts and feedback! Let's keep innovating together! ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¬
